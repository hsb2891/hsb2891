- 👋 Hi, I’m @hsb2891!

- 👀 I’m interested in helping society by contributing valuable code and services (please pardon the cliché here).

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to best grow and leverage my skills to help better society. Specifically, I'm looking into Ruby on Rails on the backend and pursuing a certificate in Data Science fundamentals.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that have a positive impact on people at a basic level. Direct impact, non-profit/humanitarian work is ideal!

- 📫 If you'd like to work with me, please reach me at hiranbuyyana [at] gmail [dot] com :D
